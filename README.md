# DrugCentral Indication Quality Analysis

Materials and data generated and analysed to assess the quality of the indication information on [DrugCentral](http://drugcentral.org/). Currently we have manually curated indications for 150 anti-cancer and cardiovascular drugs using the [Hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/) webpage annotation tool to highlight indications in digital drug labels on the [DailyMed](https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov) website. We then compare these FDA-approved indications to the ones specified by DrugCentral to determine if DrugCentral's information is accurate and precise enough.

#### Description of the contents of this repository:

1. `Analysis-figures/`\	Figures in .png format demonstrating the number of overlapping indications in our analysed datasets

2. LabeledIn-comparison/labeledin_crowd.dsv							:		Official [LabeledIn](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/lu/LabeledIn/) dataset (portion which was crowdsourced)

3. LabeledIn-comparison/labeledin_normal.dsv						:		Official [LabeledIn](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/lu/LabeledIn/) dataset (portion which was curated by human experts)

4. LabeledIn-comparison/ManualCuration+DrugCentral.csv				:		Our expert curated indications and the ones from DrugCentral for the 150 anti-cancer and cardiovascular drugs in this study 

5. LabeledIn-comparison/LabeledInParser.ipynb						:		[Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebook ([Python](https://www.python.org/)) generating LabeledIn_comparison_results_table.csv by automatically analysing  labeledin_crowd.dsv, labeledin_normal.dsv and ManualCuration+DrugCentral.csv

6. LabeledIn-comparison/LabeledIn_comparison_results_table.csv		:		The results comparing an existing drug-indication database ([LabeledIn](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/lu/LabeledIn/)) to DrugCentral and our manually curations (file is generated by LabeledInParser.ipynb)

7. MainData.xlsx													:		The main data file containing all our indication curations for DrugCentral, our manual curations, an analysis by medical experts (and computer algorithms by [Ted Pedersen](http://www.d.umn.edu/~tpederse/umls-similarity.html)) to determine semantically similar or equivalent indications despite having different names
