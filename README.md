# DrugCentral Indication Quality Analysis

Materials and data generated and analysed to assess the quality of the indication information on [DrugCentral](http://drugcentral.org/). Currently we have manually curated indications for 150 anti-cancer and cardiovascular drugs using the [Hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/) webpage annotation tool to highlight indications in digital drug labels on the [DailyMed](https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov) website. We then compare these FDA-approved indications to the ones specified by DrugCentral for the same drugs to determine if DrugCentral's information is accurate and precise enough.
